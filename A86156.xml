            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Additionall brief Narrative of a late bloody deſigne againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Anne Arundell</hi> County, and <hi>Severne</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> in the Country of <hi>VIRGINIA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT the ſixth of <hi>November</hi> laſt, in the yeare of our Lord, 1654. he ſet ſaile from the <hi>Downs,</hi> then outward bound, for the Bay of <hi>Virginia,</hi> for the Ports of <hi>Patuxent,</hi> and <hi>Severne,</hi> and through the bleſſing of God arrived at <hi>Patux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> the 29 of <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
            <p>That within two dayes after his arrivall at that Port, there came a Boat with about five perſons therein, to the Ship ſide, and by information of one of his Ships company, who formerly had been at <hi>Maryland,</hi> declared that Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> formerly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Stone,</hi> was there. He thereupon called aſſiſtants of his Ships company to Man the Ship ſide to accommodate the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up of Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> into the Ship; where after ſome civill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſhewed him, he called for a Glaſſe of Wine, and drank to him by the name of Governour <hi>Stone:</hi> At which he replyed, he had formerly been a Governour, but was not ſo now; That the Governour there at preſent was one Capt: <hi>Fuller,</hi> a Gentleman lately ſettled by the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> was then at <hi>Severne.</hi> He was likewiſe ſo informed by the Inhabitants of <hi>Patuxent,</hi> but underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any difference, or Hoſtile preparations in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>After ſome diſpatches of affaires in relation to the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Voyage, and the hard weather was broken, did on the ſixteenth day of <hi>February,</hi> early in the morning ſet ſaile for <hi>Severne,</hi> where he arrived late that night, and ſettling the Ships buſineſſe, went the next morning aſhore to attend the Governour, whom he found there; and having given the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſatisfaction as to his intended proceeding, came aboard his Ship againe.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118730:3"/>
            <p> On the fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> following, in Order to his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, left directions with Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> his Mate concerning the Ship, and Man'd forth one of his Sloopes, and himſelfe went for <hi>Roads</hi> River, ſome ſeven Leagues diſtant from thence, to procure Goods; but before he could diſpatch his buſineſſe there, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a particular Meſſage from Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> the Governour, then alſo at <hi>Severne,</hi> requiring him preſently to attend him, and that his men might preſently repaire to his Ship, then at an Anchor at <hi>Severne.</hi> He not knowing what ſpeed ſuch a Meſſage might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, left his buſineſſe, and endeavoured ſo ſoon as might be, to wait upon the Governour: But as he drew neere, he perceived a piece of Ordnance fired from his Ship, which much amazed him and his Boats crew, whereupon haſtning to the Ship, at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on board, he there found the Governour, Capt. <hi>Fuller,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> whom he had intruſted the care of his ſhip unto, and demanding the reaſon of the firing of that Gun, he told him it was by the Governours Order.</p>
            <p>The Governour forthwith related to him, That he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived certain Intelligence, that Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> with a party of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholicks, Malignant, and diſaffected perſons, who had called to their aſſiſtance a great number of Heathen, were in Arms, and what other they could not by favour perſwade, they forced along with them, plundring all that refuſed to aſſiſt them. That they had privately deſigned the deſtruction of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and all the Proteſtants at <hi>Severne,</hi> and to deſtroy men, women, and Children, that ſhould not ſubmit to their wicked deſigne. And this, the better to carry on their intereſt, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of bringing in ſubjection thoſe factious people in the County of <hi>Anne Arundell,</hi> to the obedience of the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary, not owning the Lord Protector of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. his power in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>The Governour further alſo informed him, that the deſigne was againſt him, his ſhip, and company (if they would not aſſiſt Captain <hi>Stone</hi>) to fire his Ship riding at anchor, and to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by one <hi>Abraham Hely</hi> a ſeaman who ran away from his Ship at <hi>Patuxent;</hi> and this deſigne ſo ſetled, that Captaine <hi>Stone</hi> and his ſouldiery were ready to march.</p>
            <p>The ſudden newes of ſuch horrid treachery to be acted by ſuch inſtruments, put the poore Inhabitants into ſo lamentable a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118730:3"/>condition, in reſpect they were ſo ſurprized, that they had no deliverance to expect, but onely extraordinary Providence from God, having formerly by ſad experience known the malice of their Adverſaries, againſt all that owned the wayes of God in truth.</p>
            <p>The Governor deſired that many of the poor trembling Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children might come on board the ſhip, which was granted; In the mean time his Councel and the Inhabitants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted their own ſafety, and agreed to have a Letter drawn up to be directed to Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> and ſent to him by Meſſengers of their own by the ſhips Wherry.</p>
            <p>A firſt Meſſage having been ſent to demand his power, and the ground of ſuch his proceedings.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Meſſage to him being ſuch low terms, that thoſe that ſent it were grieved at their hearts that ever it went out of their hands, which was as followeth,

            <p>This day in the evening, the Ships Watch deſcried a Boat rowing near to the ſhip, which they commanded in, and when the men were come on Board, they preſented a Letter from Cap. <hi>Stone,</hi> directed to the Relator hereof, who ſo ſoon as he received it, went forthwith aſhore, and ſhewed it to the Governor and Councel, the effect is as followeth:</p>
            <p>That he had heard the Relator would with his Ship and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany aid and aſſiſt the people of <hi>Severn</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Balte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores</hi> Government, which by perſwaſions, he deſired a deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from, and that for his ſatisfaction he had ſent a Petition preſented to His Highneſs the Lord Protector, and withall His Highneſs Order thereupon, declaring againſt the Government of <hi>Richard Bennet</hi> Eſquire in <hi>Virginia,</hi> yet in truth, ſends no ſuch thing incloſed in the Letter, but appointed the bearer to ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Capt. <hi>Fuller,</hi> and the Councel being well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as to the matter of the Letter, that it was of no greater weight, deſired the Letter might be anſwered by the Relator, as he thought fit, and ſend away the Meſſenger, who preſently writ a Letter to Cap. <hi>Stone,</hi> as followeth:

            <p> The Relator receiving daily intelligence of the threats of Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> and his party, and their Deſign againſt his Ship, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get his fraight aboard, which within a ſmal matter was now accompliſhed, and the 24 of <hi>March</hi> in the morning went aſhoat to acquaint the Governour thereof and that in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Imployers truſt he intended with the firſt Expedition to get his water aboard, and ſo depart the Port, whereupon the Governor and Councel then conſidered of the ſtoppage of the ſhip, receiving daily intelligence from all parts, how ſubtlely the intereſt of the Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> was carried on, and under ſuch pretences, and how their Adverſaries were then near at hand, drew up a ſpecial Warrant to command all parties to their aſſiſtance, and ſent for the Relator hereof, and in the preſence of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the Governor there gave him a particular and ſtrict charge, in the name of his Highneſs the Lord Protector of <hi>England &amp;c.</hi> not to offer to depart the Port without their Order, as he and his Company would anſwer the contempt thereof at their perils, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring then how much the Government eſtabliſhed by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that Province was now concerned, that their Enemies were cruel, and bloody, and very malicious againſt any that owned the Proteſtant cauſe.</p>

            <p>The Relator at his coming aboard his ſhip, upon reading the Warrant, had ſeveral debates by himſelf and Officers, and after by himſelf, and his whole ſhips company, whom he found then unanimous in their Reſolutions for relief of thoſe diſtreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that they altered not from their firſt engagements in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to defend to the utmoſt with their lives and fortunes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Government in <hi>England,</hi> and in all places the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſubordinate to that, and that the caſe of the Proteſtants there was their own, did then reſolve not to leave that Port untill God ſhould put an end to the reſtleſs condition of their Brethren, or ſuffer their deliverance to be wrought from ſo wicked a deſign (then full ripe) againſt them.</p>
            <p>The ſame day at night, in order to his ſhips Affairs, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator went a ſhoar to have his Bills of lading firmed, but ſtaid not, being required to attend the Councel, who then imparted to him the certain news of the Enemies entring the Mouth of the Harbor, with a great number of Sloopes and Boats full of men armed, with Drums and Colours, in purſuance of their deſign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required him ſpeedily to repair to his ſhip, with two of the Councel, and to obſerve their commands.</p>
            <p>That ſuddenly, or within two hours after at the moſt, in the very ſhutting up of the day-light, the ſhips company deſcried off,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118730:6"/>a company of Sloops and Boats, making towards the ſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Councel on board, and the ſhips company, would have made ſhot at them, but this Relator commanded them to forbear, and went himſelf upon the Poop in the Stern of his ſhip, and hailed them ſeveral times, &amp; no anſwer was made, he then charged them not to come nearer the ſhip, but the Enemy kept rowing on their way &amp; were come within ſhot of the ſhip; His Mates and Company having had information of their threatnings, as well againſt the ſhip as the poor diſtreſſed people, reſolved to fire upon them without their Commanders conſent, rather than hazzard all by the Enemies nearer approach, whereupon he ordered them to fire a Gun at randum to divert their courſe from the ſhip, but the Enemy kept ſtil courſe right with the ſhip, and took no notice of any warning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; He then commanded his Gunner to fire at them, but one of his Mates, Mr. <hi>Robert Morris,</hi> who knew the Country very well, the malice of the Adverſary againſt thoſe poor people, who were then near worn out with fears and watchings, made a ſhot at them, which came fairly with them; Whereupon they ſuddenly altered their courſe from the ſhip, and rowed into the Creek, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſhips Company, Rogues, Round-headed Rogues, and Dogs, and with many execrations and railing, threatned to fire them on the morning.</p>
            <p>The ſame night came further intelligence from the Enemy in the Harbor as they lay there that they were making fire-works againſt the ſhip, whereupon the Governor (whoſe prudence and valor in this buſineſs deſerves very much honor) commanded a ſmall ſhip of Capt. <hi>Cuts</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> then in the River, to lye in the mouth of the Creek to prevent the Enemies coming forth in the night, to work any miſcheif againſt the ſhip.</p>
            <p>The next morning by break of day, being the Lords day, the 25 of <hi>March</hi> laſt, the Relator, himſelf, and Company, diſcerned Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> with his whole body drawn out, and coming towards the water ſide, marching with Drums beating, Colours flying, the Colours were black and yellow appointed by the Lord <hi>Balte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> There was not the leaſt token of any ſubjection in <hi>Stone</hi> and his Company, or acknowledgement of the Lord Protector of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but <hi>God bleſs the Lord Proprietary,</hi> and their rayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſhips Company, was <hi>Rogues,</hi> and <hi>Round headed Rogues,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118730:7"/>
            <p> The Governor by this time perceiving his Enemies Quarters and now time admitted no delay, after an earneſt ſeeking of God, and laying their innocency at his feet, with his own Cauſe, in ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a part of the World, Reſolved with an humble chearfulneſs to go over to the Enemy, and withall ſent for the Engliſh Colours uſed aboard the ſhips in the ſervice of his Highneſs, which were lent, and fixed to a half pike for the Governors uſe, he having neither Drum nor Colours in his party, and then went over the River ſome ſix miles diſtant from the Enemy, and at his muſter of his party, it conſiſted of 107 and no more, the Enemys body was then 250 and upwards; as by their ſelves were related after the fight.</p>
            <p>The Governor and his Company being come to an open place, reſolved to pitch his Colours there, being the Colours of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England,</hi> which he beleeved might beget the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to incline to a parly, and prevent the ſhedding of blood; by which time the Enemy was come thither, and without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation at all, made ſeverall ſhot at the ſetting down the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and as the Relator is informed, killed two of the Governors men; whereupon the Governors Body had the word given them, <hi>In the name of God fall an, God is our ſtrength,</hi> and with very much courage gave fire at the Enemy, whoſe word was, <hi>Hey for St. Maries, Hey for two Wives,</hi> who with great boldneſs engaged likewiſe, which came to a very ſharp diſpute, though, bleſſed be God, not long till <hi>Stone</hi> and his whole party totally toured, and near forty of his men ſlain upon the place (now called by the name of the Papiſts Pound) and ſeverall deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded. And it pleaſed the good hand of God to order things ſo, that notwithſtanding the great thickneſs of the Woods and other advantages for the Enemies, being a very neck of land, there was not above five of the Enemies Body eſcaped, but what were priſoners and in cuſtody. And of the Governors Company, there was onely three killed in the field, and three ſince dead of their wounds, which unparalleled mercy did beget a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter joy than can be related; and to the Relators knowledge no Narration yet made, is to be equalized with the peoples religious, humble and holy rejoycing, each common Souldier with ſuch Chriſtian incitement revived the hearts of one another. Give the glory to the God of our deliverance.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118730:7"/>
            <p> All the Arms bag and baggage was taken together, with the Boats that brought them, wherein was the preparations and fuſes, for the firing of the ſhip <hi>Golden Lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And amongſt the reſt of their loſſes, all their conſecrated Ware was taken <hi>(viz.)</hi> their Pictures, Crucifixes, and rows of Beads, with great ſtore of Reliques and traſh they truſted in, which as the Relator is informed, divers was put to the Ancient, or Colours, for their defence; the vanity whereof as alſo their great boaſting in their own ſtrength, hath much confirmed the hearts of the people of God in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Stone</hi> himſelf was ſo convinced in this overthrow, that he declared that he did conceive he was curſed, and many ſuch like words expreſſed, in that he ſhould be brought into ſo ignominious an overthrow, and the rather, in company with thoſe who hee knew were the very direct and abſolute enemies of the people of God, and did much relent his ever undertaking their late Deſign; Declared further, That it was juſt with God to blaſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and him, and for his part, did wholly diſclaim the Lord <hi>Baltemores</hi> cauſe and intereſt, and ingaged, hee would chuſe rather to dye than own his cauſe, to joyn with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
            <p>The Relator did obſerve further, when hee came aſhore after the fight, God had put ſuch a ſpirit of fear and trembling in the hearts of the Enemy, that the poor tyred people, who ſlept as they were keeping the door where the Priſoners were put in, yet their Adverſaries durſt not attempt to run away.</p>
            <p>The Relator amongſt the Priſoners found <hi>Hely</hi> a Sea-man, who run from his Ship at <hi>Patuxe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> who was particularly brought before the Councel upon the 28. day of <hi>March,</hi> 1655. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, did there confeſs, that he was ſolicited by divers eminent Officers under Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> to ſet fire on the Ship, or blow up the Ship <hi>Golden Lion,</hi> whereof Capt. <hi>Roger Heaman</hi> is Commander. And ſome Implements and Materials delivered, and large rewards promiſed to effect it. And he further declared aboard the Ship, after he was cleared by the Governor, that the firing of the Ship ſhould have been the ſame night they came into the Harbor with their Boats, and that two of Capt. <hi>Stones</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118730:8"/>Officers were to go along with him. And for this ſervice hee was to have twenty thouſand weight of Tobacco.</p>
            <p>The Governor being daily ſolicited by the Relator for his diſpatch from thence, was ſome four dayes after the fight diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, at which time, after many thanks of the Governor and people, he ſet ſail with the firſt opportunity, and came for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuxent,</hi> where he heard a large Narration of the Enemies Threats againſt him and his Ship, and that they had burned and deſtroyed a great part of his Wood and Cask. And <hi>Hely</hi> the ſecond night of his Arrival at <hi>Patuxent</hi> fearing his Trial at his return home, run away again.</p>
            <p>The Relator in this ſo remarkable a paſſage, was an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the conſtant and religious practiſes and duties of thoſe precious ſervants of God, in thoſe remote parts, with what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of beleeving they reſted on the God of their deliverance, that neither the mallice or treachery of ſo ſubtle an Adverſary could change them, or their reſolutions, from waiting upon God for this great mercy which they before-hand did aſſuredly beleeve and ſee, as if acted already.</p>
            <p>In all this time (notwithſtanding the falſe and ſcandalous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) that the Relator himſelf ſhould be a fomenter or ſtickler amongſt the Proteſtants party, to withſtand the lawful power of Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> Governor under the Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> as ſome would ſuggeſt, he is ready to prove, he never left his ſhip at any time, unleſs about his Fraight; or when the Governor by ſpecial command enjoyned his appearance at the Councel.</p>
            <p>He could ſay much as to the pretences of Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> and others, as to the Laws for Liberties, but leaves that to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of His Highneſs the Lord Protector, that hath provided better Governors for the people of God, than profeſt enemies of his truth, and thoſe who hunt after the innocent.</p>
            <p>What he did in relation to the Proteſtants cauſe, he doubts not but good men will own, and encourage others to act the like; and to ſay no more in this, He hath ſeen the plottings of the Wicked, and the deliverance of the Innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth of this Relation, the Relator with his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and all his Ships Company, are ready to juſtifie.</hi>
